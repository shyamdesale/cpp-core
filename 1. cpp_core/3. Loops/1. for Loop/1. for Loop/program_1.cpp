/* 🧩 Definition :
        A for loop in C++ is a control structure used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.
    It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

    💡 Main Concept:
        The for loop works in three main steps:
        Initialization:
        This step initializes the loop control variable (executed only once at the beginning).
        Condition:
        The loop runs as long as this condition is true. When it becomes false, the loop stops.
        Update (Increment/Decrement):
        This part updates the loop variable after each iteration.
