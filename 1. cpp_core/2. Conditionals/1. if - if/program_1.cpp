    /* Multiple if Condition Defination :
        Multiple if statements are used when you want to check more than one condition independently.
        Each if is checked separately, so all true conditions will execute their blocks.

    Main Concept of Multiple if

        Used to check multiple conditions independently.
        Each if is evaluated separately, so more than one block can run if multiple conditions are true.
        Ideal when more than one action may need to happen for different conditions.
        If you want only one action to execute, use if … else if … else instead.

    ✅ Key idea: All conditions are checked, not just the first true one.
