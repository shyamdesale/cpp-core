/*🔹 Ternary Operator Defination :
    The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement — it allows you to make quick conditional decisions in a single line.

🔹 Main Concept :
    It checks a condition, and based on whether it’s true or false, it chooses one of two expressions to execute or return.

🔹 Syntax :
    condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
