/* if - else Defination :
    The if-else statement is a decision-making statement used to execute one block of code
    if a condition is true and another block if it is false.

Syntax :
if (condition) {
     Code to execute if condition is TRUE
}
else {
     Code to execute if condition is FALSE
}

Main Concept :
    Used for decision making when there are two possible outcomes.
    If the condition is true, the if block executes.
    If the condition is false, the else block executes.
    Only one block executes—never both.
